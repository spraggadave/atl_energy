/*
THis query extracts from BigQuery's 2017 ACS public dataset a subset of data 
for only the zipcodes of buildings we have in the atl_energy_score_data.csv file.

The data for the atl_energy_score_data.csv comes from teh Atlanta Building
efficiency website (https://atlantabuildingefficiency.com/benchmarking-data/) and 
needs to be manually downloaded by clicking the first row, olding shift and
then clicking the last row in the table.  Once that's done, an icon to explore the 
data will pop up, and you need to click it and select "download all rows as text file"
to get the CSV.

Once the CSV is downloaded, you can uploaded to Big Query as a table with the same name.
SOme cleanup of zipcodes will be required first in order to allow for searching by zip code (
since the zips are embedded in the address field and are not a standalone column.
This can be done in Excel or Google Sheets.
